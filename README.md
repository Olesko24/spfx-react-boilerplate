## Prerequisites üõ†

First check out the official recommended development environment setup for SharePoint SPFx: [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

If the Versions in that Documentation has been changed here are the Versions this Template got created with:

### Used SPFx Version

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.19.1-green.svg)

### Environment

| Software | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| Node     | 18.19.0 |

To use the correct Node version install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). It makes changing the Node version much easier!

Run the following in the terminal:

```bash
nvm use #this will take the specified version in the .nvmrc file

# optional
nvm install 18

nvm use 18
```

For more detailed Information check out the [nvm usage documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage).

### Environment

Check out the detailed Guide from Microsoft to get the latest versions:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment

## SPFx Fast Serve Tool

See official Package description [here](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve?tab=readme-ov-file).

Best Tool ever for SharePoint Development!!!

## Settings üõ†

### Development üßë‚Äçüíª

**`config/serve.json`**

```json
{
  ...
  "initialPage": "https://enter-your-SharePoint-site/_layouts/workbench.aspx" // change the URL here and replace "enter-your-SharePoint-site" with your SharePoint URL
}
```

## Deployment üõ´

This Section describes how to deploy your Webpart to your SharePoint Tenant. Feel free to copy this step to your documentation because its the same for every Webpart.

_Requires that you have cloned this repository and made the previous changes._

### Minimal Path to Awesome (Test Deployment) üî¨

Open a new Terminal in the root folder of this Project and run the following Code:

```bash
gulp trust-dev-cert # only for first deployment

npm run serve # will use spfx-fast-serve

# deprecated
gulp serve # will open a new tab in your default browser with the workbench
```

### Maximum Path to Awesome (Production Deployment) üí°

```bash
gulp clean # optional

npm run bundle:ship

gulp package-solution --ship
```

This commands will create a new `.sppkg` file in the `sharepoint/solution` folder. This file contains all the information and code for your Webpart.

### How to upload to App Catalog

Navigate to the App Catalog in your SharePoint Tenant. Usually the URL looks like this:

`https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/SitePages/Home.aspx`

The Page looks like this:

<img src=./docs/app_catalog_1.png width="850" />

Click on the first square/button. On the next page just drag and drop the previously created `.sppkg` file in the table.

**Upload with NodeJS**

> This Section hasnt been tested yet! üöß

First you have to authenticate yourself in the Azure Active Directory. After you got the necessary Credentials follow the Guide [here](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/blob/version-3/docs/getting-started.md#using-pnpsp-spfi-factory-interface-in-nodejs).

After you got the Authentication its possible to upload the `.sppkg` with the ALM api provided by the [PnP sp](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/sp/alm/#pnpspappcatalog) package.

Run the following commands in the command line:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout keytmp.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -passout pass:yourPasswordHere

openssl rsa -in keytmp.pem -out key.pem -passin pass:yourPasswordHere
```

> The above Code will generate three files, `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, and `keytmp.pem`. Upload the `cert.pem` file to Azure AD application registration. The `key.pem` file will be read in the configuration.

```typescript
// this represents the file bytes of the app package file
const blob = new Blob();

// there is an optional third argument to control overwriting existing files
const r = await catalog.add("myapp.app", blob);

// this is at its core a file add operation so you have access to the response data as well
// as a File instance representing the created file
console.log(JSON.stringify(r.data, null, 4));

// all file operations are available
const nameData = await r.file.select("Name")();
```

**Upload with Powershell**

> This Section hasnt been tested yet! üöß

This method uses the [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/) package.

```Powershell
#Parameters
$AppCatalogURL = "https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/sites/apps"
$AppFilePath = "./sharepoint/solution/sharepoint-app.sppkg"

#Connect to SharePoint Online App Catalog site
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $AppCatalogURL -Interactive

#Add App to App catalog - upload app to sharepoint online app catalog using powershell
$App = Add-PnPApp -Path $AppFilePath

#Deploy App to the Tenant
Publish-PnPApp -Identity $App.ID -Scope Tenant
```

### Configure Solution Settings

Solution Settings file is saved in `config/package-solution.json`.

Follow [this Guide](https://pnp.github.io/blog/post/spfx-21-professional-solutions-superb-solution-packages/) to configure all the mandatory settings.

## Optional üí°

### Full-Width Column

To have the Webpart use the full width of the Website its mandatory to adjust some settings and enable the Full-Width Column. But there are some Restrictions you have to consider.

**Create new Web**

Be patient when you create a new Web. The full width column is **not available on Team Sites**. We have to create a new **Communication Site**.

<img src=./docs/full_width_column_web.png width="850" />

<br />

**`manifest.json`**

```json
{
  ...
  "supportsFullBleed": true,
  ...
}
```

Now its possible to select the Webpart in a full width column on a SharePoint Site.

To add it follow the instructions on this screenshot:

<img src=./docs/full_width_column_section.png width="400" />

<br />

**Development for Full-Width Column**

In the Workbench the Webpart will always be just in a small part of the page. To make it fullscreen use the following styling in your `WebpartName.module.scss` file. This will make the webpart use the full size of the screen.

```css
:global {
  #workbenchPageContent,
  .CanvasComponent.LCS .CanvasZone {
    max-width: 100% !important;
  }
}
```

### Webpart Icon

[Official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/basics/configure-web-part-icon)

To customize your Webpart Icon edit the following line in the `WebpartNameWebPart.manifest.json` file:

**You can only use one of the following options!**

```json
{
  ...
  "preconfiguredEntries": [
    {
      ...
      // Option 1 (Image URL):
      "iconImageUrl": "https://example.website.com/image.png",
      // Option 2 (Fluent UI Icon):
      "officeFabricIconFontName": "Sunny",
      // Option 3 (Base64 Image):
      "iconImageUrl": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB4AAAAQ4CAIAAABnsVYUAAFP2klEQVR42uzd..."
    }
  ]
}
```

You can find all the available Fluent UI Icons [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons).

## Development

### Component Library üìö

**Fluent UI**

Fluent UI is developed by the Microsoft Team and integrates its components perfectly into the SharePoint/Microsoft environment.
Its also already installed in the dependencies of this project (`@microsoft/sp-office-ui-fabric-core`) so you can use their components out of the box.
The possibility to work with [themes](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/theming) in Fluent UI is also pretty useful and makes styling easier.

**Useful Resources:**

- [Fluent UI Components](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web)
- [Fluent UI Icons](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons)

### Package Solution Assets (Lists)

In the Package Solution Assets its possible to put models for Lists that will be created when the App is installed.

*Important: Works only for Site-App-Installation, not for global Installation!*

With this Feature its possible to update Lists with new Features and that is pretty useful.

**Useful Resources:**

 - [Assets Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/provision-sp-assets-from-package)
 - [Field Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/field-element-field?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
 - [List Schemas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/list-instances)
 - [List Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/list-element-list)
 - [List Template ID's](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/archive/blogs/vinitt/list-of-feature-id-listtemplate)

## Property Pane üìã

**Useful Resources:**

- [PnP SPFx Controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/)
- [SPFx Property Pane Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/basics/integrate-with-property-pane)

## SPFx Lifecycle Hooks üîÑ

### Webpart

Quoted from [this site](https://www.vrdmn.com/2019/12/sharepoint-framework-web-part-and.html).

When loading the web part on a page the methods are executed in the following order:

```typescript
// 1.
protected onAfterDeserialize(deserializedObject: any, dataVersion: Version): TProperties;
// 2.
protected onInit(): Promise<void>;
// 3.
protected render(): void;
// 4.
protected onBeforeSerialize(): void
```

When the web part is removed from a page the methods are executed in the following order:

```typescript
// 1.
protected onDispose(): void;
```

### Property Pane

**Open**

```typescript
// 1.
protected loadPropertyPaneResources(): Promise<void>
// 2.
protected getPropertyPaneConfiguration(): IPropertyPaneConfiguration;
// 3.
protected onPropertyPaneRendered(): void;
// 4.
protected onPropertyPaneConfigurationStart(): void;
```

**Update**

There are two modes that have to be differentiated: reactive mode or non-reactive mode.

> Reactive implies that changes made in the PropertyPane are transmitted to the web part instantly and the user can see instant updates. This helps the page creator get instant feedback and decide if they should keep the new configuration changes or not. NonReactive implies that the configuration changes are transmitted to the web part only after "Apply" PropertyPane button is clicked."

reactive mode

```typescript
// 1.
protected onPropertyPaneFieldChanged(propertyPath: string, oldValue: any, newValue: any): void;
// 2.
protected render(): void;
// 3.
protected getPropertyPaneConfiguration(): IPropertyPaneConfiguration;
// 4.
protected onPropertyPaneRendered(): void;
// 5.
protected onPropertyPaneConfigurationComplete(): void;
```

non-reactive mode

```typescript
// 1.
protected onPropertyPaneFieldChanged(propertyPath: string, oldValue: any, newValue: any): void;
// 2.
protected getPropertyPaneConfiguration(): IPropertyPaneConfiguration;
// 3.
protected onPropertyPaneRendered(): void;
```

Events after the "Apply" Button got clicked:

```typescript
// 1.
protected onAfterPropertyPaneChangesApplied(): void;
// 2.
protected render(): void;
// 3.
protected onPropertyPaneConfigurationComplete(): void;
// 4.
protected onPropertyPaneRendered(): void;
```

**Close**

```typescript
// 1.
protected onPropertyPaneConfigurationComplete(): void;
```

## REST Api üì•

Working with the REST Api in SPFx Webparts is pretty easy. The best solution is to use the `@pnp/sp` package because it already provides you with all the important functions in a promise-based system.

Insert the following code to your `WebpartNameWebPart.ts` file:

```typescript
import { spfi, SPFx } from "@pnp/sp";
...
protected async onInit(): Promise<void> {
  await super.onInit();
  const sp = spfi().using(SPFx(this.context));
  ...
}
...
```

## Logging üìÉ

When it comes to logging in your application there is an out of the box tool by Microsoft which you can use, but it works a little bit different than the native `console.log()`. Its still possible to use the native `console.log()` script but there are cases when the Microsoft Logging is better or more useful.

To use the Microsoft Logging Tool follow this example:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@microsoft/sp-core-library';

...
const LOG_SOURCE: string = "HelloWorldWebPart";

Log.info(LOG_SOURCE, 'Hello World this is an info log.')
Log.verbose(LOG_SOURCE, 'Hello, this is a verbose log.')
Log.warn(LOG_SOURCE, 'Hello, this is a waning log.')
Log.error(LOG_SOURCE, new Error('Hello, this is a error log!')) //Log.error needs an Error Object
```

Check out the [official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/sp-core-library/log?view=sp-typescript-latest).

> The Log class provides static methods for logging messages at different levels (verbose, info, warning, error) and with context information. Context information helps identify which component generated the messages and allows for filtering of log events. In a SharePoint Framework application, these messages will appear on the developer dashboard.

In the Log method description its written that the logs are shown in the _developer dashboard_. So what is that? I also didnt heard of this before but after some research i found a Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-developer-dashboard).

To open the _developer dashbord_ in SharePoint you have to press the keys <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> or on MacOS also works <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> .

## Git Commits ‚úâ

We are using the packages `husky` and `commitlint` to keep control of the git commit messages. The configuration can be found in the `commitlint.config.js` file.

`commitlint` will throw an error if the commit message is not like the expected syntax or the "type" is not existing in the list of avaliable types. You can find the available types in the `commitlint.config.js` file. [Here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) you can find some explanations for the types but most of them are self explaining.

An error can look like this:

<img src=./docs/commitlint_error.png width="900" />

## Known Issues üöß

**`module.scss` not found**

After you create a new `module.scss` file it sometimes isnt recognized in the code when you try to import the styles into your `.tsx` file.

<img src=./docs/issue_scss_not_found.png width="600" />

To solve this error just run `gulp serve` in the command line.
